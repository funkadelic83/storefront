# storefront

This is a CLI node app to manage inventory for an online camera store, Bamazon. It requires the mysql and inquirer npm packages. If the program's MySQL database were public and stored online, here's how it would work:

# Bamazon Customer

Open Git Bash (or other command-line program) and run "node bamazonCustomer.js". This will run the prompt as seen in the [following video] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xmkba3UuTMqOQkozGkCOzw5leOboeA7R/view?usp=sharing).

From here, customers can select which products are for sale and purchase products. The program will not allow sales if inventory is insufficient.

# Bamazon Manager

Open Git Bash (or other command-line program) and run "node bamazonManager.js".

With Bamazon Manager, users can view the inventory, add more inventory, view which items are low on inventory, or add new products.

## Exit out of either program by typing "Control + C".
